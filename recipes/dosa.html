    Description
</h2>
<p>
    A dosa is a thin (usually crispy) flat bread originating from South India, made from a fermented batter predominantly consisting of lentils and rice. Its main ingredients are rice and black gram, ground together in a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt, then fermented. Dosas are a common dish in South Indian cuisine, but now have become popular all over the Indian subcontinent. Dosas are served hot along with chutney by tradition and sambar in recent times. Other accompaniments include chutney (a fine paste made up of groundnut, coconut and lentil).

<p>
    Dosas originated in South India; their exact birthplace in that region is a matter of conjecture. According to historian P. Thankappan Nair, dosa originated in the Udupi town of present-day Karnataka.However, there are also references according to food historian K. T. Achaya, that dosa (as dosai) was already in use in the ancient Tamil country around the 1st century AD, as per references in the Sangam literature. Nevertheless, Dosa is a dish whose origin is from the southern part of India.
